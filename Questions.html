<h1>Discussion Questions</h1>
        </div>
 
    <h3>Reading 1</h3>
        <p>1. Given that the internet is becoming increasingly sponsored and commodified by corporations, will corporations attempt to counter the suggested artist website movement? If so, how?</p>
        <p>2. Will VR internet chatrooms such as VRchat make the internet more like dining cars on the internet, as users have to present more of who they are than a text chatroom?</p>
        <p>3. How will “netiquette” and internet professionalism change given that the internet is no longer a safe place to express one’s self? Is a more offline or online future ahead?</p>
        
        <br>
    <h3>Reading 2</h3>
        <p>1. Since GUIs have enabled the gamification of war, what would the gamification of other settings look like? (Ie is there a future for the gamification of nature) </p>
        <p>2. Given that style is cyclical (resurgence of vinyl, polaroids, Y2K aesthetic, etc), do you think there will be a mainstream return to less abstraction/illusion GUI for general user software?</p>
        <p>3. What are the major differences between designing natively for screens vs designing natively for VR? Since the medium allows for more realistic 3D visualization, would designing natively mean more or less abstraction?</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Reading 3</h3>
        <p>1. What is a realistic amount of privacy for our own DNA? While ideally we would have full control over who has access to it, who can replicate it, etc that doesn’t feel realistic in the near future</p>
        <p>2. Is there going to be a shift away from performative living or is it going to get worse, given that validation from strangers is still a powerful motive?</p>
        <p>3. Would you use the DNA wiper kit? Why/why not?</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Reading 4</h3>
        <p>1. Given the ever changing nature of the internet, is archiving the web ethical? For example, you could have made an uninformed post several years ago only to delete it a few weeks later after people told you it was offensive, but in that time the internet archive could have scanned and archived it forever.</p>
        <p>2. How can we combine archiving as a form of resistance and peer to peer, decentralized networks? Should/will these networks ever stand up to corporate run networks? If so, how?</p>
        <p>3. What are some of the dangers of letting ISPs have as much power as they currently do? What do you think the future of ISPs will look like></p><br>
        
    
        <h3>Reading 5</h3>
        <p>1. It’s no secret that memes have become increasingly absurdist and dadaist. Is there a common theme among the “postmodern memes”? What could be causing this shift? What will be next in the evolution of memes? </p>
        <p>2. Corporate memes and corporate backed meme accounts are on the rise. While some feel that this is the next logical stage of advertising, this form of marketing is controversial. What do you think about meme based marketing? </p>
        <p>3. Do you think that glitch art and “poor image” art is in response to the increasingly digitally reliant world, or is it simply cyclical like fashion and “alternative” mediums like polaroids and vinyl?</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Reading 6</h3>
        <p>1. It seems data collection is often a trade: give up your data for security or to use a “free” service. However, the type of data collection discussed here feels almost non-consensual (facial scans, databases of people as objects, etc). What could the future of non-consensual data collection look like? </p>
        <p>2. Mimi Onuoha mentioned not being surprised when two coworkers moved in together because “it was in the data already.” This implies future determinism: if someone can predict our future moves using our past data and previous actions, how close are we to automatons?</p>
        <p>3. What will the future of digital privacy look like? Privacy from corporations, privacy from mass collection of data, privacy from each other?</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Reading 7</h3>
        <p>1. What are other examples of predictive analysis limiting our potential for human growth? Is it possible to dismantle the current level of predictive analysis across the internet, or are we “too far gone”?</p>
        <p>2. Is there a space for non-violent, non-creative code (ie non violent corporate code)? Many corporations may not like the concept because it’s more time consuming to be thoughtful. What would you say to them?</p>
        <p>3. While digitizing cultural heritage/creating digital cultural projects are a wonderful way of preserving and distributing an entire culture, what are some of the downsides to digital formats that are specific to cultural projects?</p>
        
        <br>
        <h3>Reading 8</h3>
        <p>1. Predictive policing AI has been shown to lead to overpolicing time and time again. Yet a significant portion of both citizens and police continue to advocate for its use. What do these people stand to gain/lose if widespread predictive policing is ever implemented?</p>
        <p>2. Police use of spying, surveillance, and undercover tactics has been shown to be corrupt, racist, and in many cases, illegal. What is a more feasible solution, to end the use of these tactics, instituting an oversight committee, or defunding the police? Which is more realistic, and why?</p>
        <p>3. Respectful and ecologically centered design are on the rise, yet they require much more thoughtfulness and care. Does the concept scale up? Will there be a future mainstream title of “ecological based design consultant” for large projects? Why or why not?</p>
